# Climate_Analysis

Background 

The Jupyter Notebook contains the climate analysis for precipitation and temperature in Honolulu, HI from 08-23-2017 to 08-23-2017 (last twelve months of data). It also looks at specific trip dates from 07-01-2017 to 07-14-2017 to model the climate temperature normals and precipitation based on historical weather data.

Also included an Flask API Application to query:

Precipitations from last year
Weather stations
Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year
Minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start and/or start-end range inlcusive.
